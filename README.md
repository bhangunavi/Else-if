# Java Else-If Statement üß©

This repository is all about understanding and practicing **else-if** statements in Java. The `else-if` construct is a powerful decision-making tool that allows you to check multiple conditions and execute the code for the first true condition.

## üåü What is an Else-If Statement?
The `else-if` statement in Java is used to test multiple conditions in sequence. It allows the program to choose from multiple options by evaluating conditions one by one. If a condition evaluates to `true`, its block of code is executed, and the rest of the conditions are ignored.

## üõ†Ô∏è Syntax
Here‚Äôs the basic syntax of an **else-if** ladder:
```java
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // Code to execute if condition3 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
}
